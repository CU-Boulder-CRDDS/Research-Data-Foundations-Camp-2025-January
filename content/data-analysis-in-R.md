# Data Analysis in R

## Instructor

Ellery Galvin (she/hers)\
PhD Student, Applied Mathematics\
Statistics Specialist, Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship  

## Introduction

This section provides a primer on using R and R Studio for data-based research.  The first session from 10-12 teaches fundamental skills all R programmers should know: functions, variables, installing packages, loading data, vectors, dataframes, wrangling, and visualization.  It assumes the participant has never coded before.  The second session from 1-2 covers modeling and statistics, assuming the content studied in the morning: t-tests, linear models, ANOVA, and mixed effects.  The session covers programming skills and some statistics concepts as well.  The third session covers fundamental skills in text mining: wordclouds, tm, and stringr.

## Preliminaries

### R and R Studio Installation

For instructions on how to download R and R Studio, please see the following: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download). If it is not possible to install the software on your computer, please create a [free Posit Cloud account](https://posit.cloud/plans/free). Log in to your account and upload all the code and data files provided on this page.  Run the session packages installation script as described below, in the **Session Packages** section. 

### Session data

Before beginning the lesson, please download the data to a directory on your computer. Simply click the blue button below:

[Download Data](data-analysis-in-R/presentation_materials/wos.zip){: .btn .btn-blue }. 

### Session Packages

Please make sure to install the R packages that will be used in the lesson before it begins. To do so, please first download the following R Script by clicking on the blue button below:

[Download Package Installation Script](data-analysis-in-R/presentation_materials/setup.R){: .btn .btn-blue }. 

After opening up the script in R Studio, click the *Source* button at the top right of the top left panel. This button will run the code in the file. The code installs all the packages needed for the lesson. This process should not take more than 15 minutes; if you encounter any issues, please email the instructor before the lesson at the following address: [elga3498@colorado.edu](mailto:elga3498@colorado.edu).
