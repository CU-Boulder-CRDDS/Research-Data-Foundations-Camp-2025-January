## Python Installation

Python Installation
The Python workshop uses several packages which need to be installed in addition to Python itself. There are several way to install all these requirements depending on your preference with using a Graphic User interfaces (GUI) or a Command-line Interface (CLI).

GUI Option – Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

Anaconda is a data science platform which comes with all but one of the required packages needed for the Python workshop. Please [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (you can skip the registration) and install Anaconda in advance of this workshop, accepting the default options during installation. To install the missing package please do the following: 
1.	Open the Anaconda Navigator and click the "Environments" button on the left.
2.	Change the “Installed” dropdown to “Not installed”,  then enter plotnine in the search packages field
3.	From the list of packages, click the empty box next to plotnine, then click Apply

CLI Option – Using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda. It can be installed completely from the CLI with [installation instructions for all operating systems](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install). With Miniconda installed, we’ll need to install all the packages required for this workshop. The quickest way to installed these packages is by running the following conda commands:
1.	conda install -y numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
2.	conda install -c conda-forge plotnine

It should be noted that Anaconda and Miniconda are free for research purposes, but should you require a solution without limitations on use, please try the Miniconda equivalent [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org/). The above conda commands for installing the required packages are the same.

Virtual Office hours are available on Wednesday at 3:30 to assist with installation of Python and the required packages.
